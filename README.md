# Automated Market Maker (AMM) Project

## Project Title
Automated Market Maker (AMM)

## Project Description
The Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized trading mechanism that allows users to trade assets without the need for order books. Instead, liquidity is provided by users who add tokens to liquidity pools, and trades are made against the reserves of these pools. The price of assets is determined by a mathematical formula, ensuring liquidity at all times.

This contract implements a basic AMM for two tokens, allowing users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap between two ERC-20 tokens. It uses a simple constant product formula (x * y = k) to maintain the balance between token reserves and facilitate trades.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) project is to create a decentralized and trustless environment for token trading. By utilizing liquidity pools, the project aims to remove intermediaries and provide a seamless, decentralized way to exchange tokens without relying on traditional order book systems.

## Key Features
- **Add Liquidity**: Users can add tokens to the liquidity pool, increasing the available liquidity.
- **Remove Liquidity**: Users can withdraw their portion of liquidity from the pool.
- **Token Swapping**: Users can swap one token for another (Token A for Token B and vice versa) based on the current reserves.
- **Constant Product Formula**: The AMM uses a constant product formula (x * y = k) to determine prices based on the ratio of reserves, ensuring that liquidity is always available for swaps.
- **Decentralized and Trustless**: The contract is fully decentralized, with no need for a central authority to handle trades or liquidity.

## Future Scope
- **Multi-Token AMM**: Future updates could allow for multi-token liquidity pools, enabling more complex swaps with multiple tokens.
- **Automated Price Adjustment**: Integration with external price oracles to automatically adjust liquidity pool prices based on market conditions.
- **Impermanent Loss Protection**: Implement mechanisms to reduce the impact of impermanent loss for liquidity providers.
- **Integration with Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: The AMM can be integrated with larger decentralized exchanges for wider usage.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Introducing a governance token and decentralized voting to manage future changes to the contract.
- **Improved Security**: Continuous auditing and improvements to the security of the smart contract to ensure safe interactions for all users.

## How to Use
1. Deploy the contract with two ERC-20 token addresses.
2. Use `addLiquidity()` to add liquidity to the pool.
3. Use `removeLiquidity()` to withdraw your liquidity.
4. Use `swapAtoB()` or `swapBtoA()` to trade between the two tokens.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository or create a new project.
2. Install dependencies like OpenZeppelin for ERC-20 implementation:
